Me & Thee
=========

Hiya! I'm FÃ©lix Saparelli, also known as [passcod](https://passcod.net). I lurk
on the streets of Auckland (and some other places), New Zealand, as well as on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/passcod). I land some cool Javascript and Ruby
stuff &mdash; and some crappy things, too :)

You are just passing, but if you've read until the very end, then I'm pretty
sure I like you. So I'll give you all this, for free, fully free (freedoms be
damned!). This work is released in the [Public Domain](https://passcod.net/license.html).
